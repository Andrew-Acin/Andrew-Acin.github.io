- Tile of game:
  Maze Game

- Description:
  This is a simple Maze type mage that i decide to try and make, the idea came from my son Henry that wanted me to make a maze for him.

The main goal of my game is to create a maze and have a character move around by using the arrow keys and find the exit.

This is my second attempt at making a maze type game, i was not happy with how my first one was going and found some usefull videos on how to make it much better.

- Game Logic:
- 1.Describe the logic involved in player decisions.
- What are the choices available to the player?:
  The game is quite simple to players, only the arrow keya are needed to play the game.

Players choices are really only to choose which route to take in the maze to fine the exit.

- What happens when the player makes a choice?
  Players choices are really only to choose which route to take in the maze to fine the exit.

* Describe the logic that leads to a player winning/closing/completing the game.
* How will a player know they have won, lost and/or finished the game?

There is no real losing in this game as the player is free to backtrack and take a differnt path to the exit.

The player will know they have completed the game when they reach the exit as there will be a cut scene type end with a message, they will also not be able to continue moving the charater around as it will be a differnt screen.

- Deployment
This game is live on https://andrew-acin.github.io/

Links to website i need to make this game.

I found this artist pixel art that was specific for games which i used for the map and character.

I used quite a lot of code that this person made a walk through for his own game which i changed up to make my own.

- Stretch goals 
I would like to add the forgrounds to make the player walk behind objects when walking.
I would like to add extra maps to make the game longer so would need to connect more maps to exits.
Add obsticles that player needs to avoid to continue.
