# Milestone-Project-Game-Second-Attempt-Andrew-Acin


This is my seconds attempt at making a maze type game, i was not happy with how my first one was going and found some usefull videos on how to make it better.

The main goal of my game is to create a maze and have a character move around by using the arrow keys and find the exit.
